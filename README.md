# Final_Project

For the final project, energy generation technologies will be compared from the data available on the OpenEI website. Link: https://openei.org/apps/TCDB/download-data.html I am interested in the “Generation data” file, it was updated last in 2015.

The dataset in this file contains different energy generation technologies’ (Renewable and Fossil Fuel) data for present-day as well as potential improvements. about their operating cost and variable cost, availability factor (Used to calculate capacity factor), thermal efficiencies, and many more parameters. 

The dataset also includes the year the data was published and the year to which it estimated to. There are a total of 10307 rows and 42 columns of data for a total data of over 432600 datapoints. The file consists of many missing data so it will have to be formatted and remove the outliers and necessary data manipulation will be performed. Data will be analyzed extensively across the parameters mentioned above and many visualization plots will be plotted to visualize the data and analysis.

Hypothesis: Using levelized cost calculation, compare the cost of energy generation technology across wide range of Fossil and Renewable technology. Analyze the associated fixed andvariable operating cost of the technology. Calculate, plot and compare the capacity factor of each technology. Compare and plot the thermal efficiency, and how much CO2 is generating per megawatt hours. Finally, how many years it potentially takes to build the technology and cross compare it with other technologies to verify its viability. Lastly, using all this data, to determine if renewable energy can replace the fossil fuel energy, how it could replace, and what can be the
potential drawbacks.
