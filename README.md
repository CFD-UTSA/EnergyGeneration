Final Project Information:

Introduction:

Due to increase in the climate change problems, there has been an increase in need to switch to renewable energy sources from the non-renewable energy sources to curb the greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions. 

Scope:

The scope of this project will focus on analyzing the sustainability of the Renewable Energy Sources and compare the CO2 emissions data in a location with concentration of Renewable Energy Sources versus a location with more Non-Renewable sources. Also, visualize the changes in air temperature induced by greenhouse gases on a map.

Hypothesis:

It is hypothesized that due to the increase in the availability of the Renewable Energy sources, the sustainability of them have improved significantly cost wise. Also, due to increase in the Renewable Energy sources a drop in CO2 can occur.

Analysis:

It is desired to investigate the levelized cost of energy to determine the sustainability of the plant. 
Plot the associated fixed operating cost and variable operating cost of each technology. 
Plot and analyze the thermal efficiency, and how much CO2 is generating per megawatt hours to investigate which technology us sustainable.
Furthermore, the yearly data of CO2 emissions at two locations, where Renewable Energy source is dominant versus location where Non-Renewable Energy source is dominant, will be investigated to see if there are any short-term changes in the emissions.

Code Capabilities:

Energy generation technologies will be compared from the data available on the OpenEI website. Link: https://openei.org/apps/TCDB/download-data.html The “Generation data” file will be used for this study. It is a CSV file last updated in 2015. 
The CO2 emissions data will be extracted directly from the openaq website.https://openaq.org/#/
The satellilte data is directly extracted from the NASA's website for the surface temperature through: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/
Further, the satellite image will be displayed for visualization of the Temperature changes across US.
