# Final Project: Energy Generation Technology's Cost & Performance Study

For the final project, energy generation technologies will be compared from the data available on the OpenEI website. Link: https://openei.org/apps/TCDB/download-data.html I am interested in the “Generation data” file, it was updated last in 2015.Variables for display are extracted as published from public reports cited. Additional data not directly displayed but relevant to the estimates are collected and stored in the database for reference. Examples of these are plant scale, resource quality, dollar year used, etc. The US Department of Energy (DOE) applied energy R&D, including the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) covers a wide variety of applications, so methodology necessarily varies by sector and technology specifics

The dataset in this file contains different energy generation technologies’ (Renewable and Fossil Fuel) data for present-day as well as potential improvements about their operating cost, variable cost, capacity factor, thermal efficiencies, lead time, asset life, and CO2 emissions per technology. 

There are a total of 10302 rows and 63 columns of data for a total data of over 400000 datapoints. The file consists of many missing data so data manipulation will be performed extensively to obtain the data required for analysis. Data will be analyzed extensively across the parameters mentioned above and many visualization plots will be plotted to visualize to compare the differences. 

Hypothesis: Using levelized cost calculation, compare to see which technology have smaller breakeven values. Analyze the associated fixed andvariable operating cost of the technology. Plot and compare the capacity factor of each technology. Compare and plot the thermal efficiency, and how much CO2 is generating per megawatt hours. Finally, plot how many years it potentially takes to build each technology and cross compare it with the lifetime of asset. Lastly, using all this data, to determine if renewable energy can replace the fossil fuel energy.

Further compare the SW and NE of United States with the amount of CO2 concentration as NE is more concentrated with Non-Renewable Energy plants while SW is more Renewable Energy plants.
